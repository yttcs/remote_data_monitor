## Earthquake Datafile Monitor

### Monitor the USGS Signifcant Earthquakes data file for any updates by polling it for download, at some time increment, and comparing it with the last downloaded version that was saved. If there is an update (a change in the newest downloaded file) then save the difference (updates only), create a visualization from it, and send an email with the new visualization as an attachment. In addition, send an sms message notification of the email event. On the other hand, if there isn't an update (no difference between files) then delete the redundant download and continue to poll. Finally, all the visualizations, their source files, and the original (non redundant) downloaded files are date/time stamped and saved to disk - for possible later analysis.
